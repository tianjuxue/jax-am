# Quick Start


Refer to  [`applications/`](https://github.com/tianjuxue/jax-am/tree/main/applications) for a variety of examples. For example, run

```bash
python -m applications.fem.demo.example
```
from the root directory will run a finite element example.


We will build (much) better documentation in the future. Stay tuned!
